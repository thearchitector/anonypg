> "In order to preserve privacy, there are five types of anonymization operations, namely generalization, suppression, anatomization, permutation and perturbation. Generalization replaces values with more generic ones. Suppression removes specific values from data sets (e.g., replacing values with specific ones like “*”). Anatomization disassociates relations between quasi-identifiers and sensitive attributes. Furthermore, permutation disassociates a relation between a quasi-identifier and sensitive attribute by dividing a number of data records into groups and mixing their sensitive values in every group. Perturbation replaces original values with new ones by interchanging, adding noise or creating synthetic data. These anonymization operations decrease data utility, which is represented by information loss in general. In other words, higher data utility means lower information loss."
